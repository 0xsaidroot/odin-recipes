    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Koki beans, also known as Koki de Niébé, are a traditional West African dish made primarily from black-eyed peas. The beans are peeled, ground into a smooth paste, and mixed with bold ingredients like red palm oil, spices, and sometimes onions or hot peppers. This vibrant orange mixture is then wrapped in banana leaves and steamed, creating a savory cake-like dish that’s rich, dense, and full of flavor. Koki is especially popular in Cameroon, where it’s often served at festive gatherings, weddings, and community events.</p>
    <p>What makes koki beans extra iconic is their deep cultural roots and the way they blend simple, earthy ingredients into something that feels almost luxurious. They’re vegetarian-friendly, high in protein, and super filling, making them a go-to comfort food. Koki isn’t just food—it’s heritage on a plate, wrapped in banana leaves and steamed with love. Whether you eat it solo or paired with plantains or cassava, it’s giving flavor, nostalgia, and vibes.</p>
